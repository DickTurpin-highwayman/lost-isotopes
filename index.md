## 2 Isotopes of iridium 192 were lost in Port Moresby
### capitol city of Papua New Guinea – in 1999

They were recovered by police – a after a `shootout` `workshop-template-b`

The loss of the dangerous isotopes was never reported to the radioactive-sources authorities !

The police were deliberately left unaware of the seriousness of the situation at the time of their recovery
