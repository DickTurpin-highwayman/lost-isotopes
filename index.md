## 2 Isotopes of iridium 192 were lost in Papua New Guinea – in 1999
#### from an apartment block in the capitol city of Port Moresby

They were recovered by police – a after a **shootout !**

The loss of the dangerous isotopes was **never reported** to the radioactive-sources authorities !

The police seem to have been deliberately left unaware of the seriousness of the situation at the time of their recovery & were more concerned about the amount of bullet holes in the car “… we think about 18”

The camera is the size of a large handbag but can weigh up to 30kg -- not easy to lose you’d think

It was lost because it was stored in the boot of a car instead of the legally required safe storage facility. The car was stolen from the carpark of the company office/accommodation unit in an apartment block in Airvos Avenue

The dangerous isotopes were usually stored inside the apartment or the boot of the car instead of an approved storage facility – *away from people*
