## 2 Isotopes of iridium 192 were lost in Papua New Guinea -- in 1999
##### They were taken along with a car, parked in an apartment block in the capitol city of Port Moresby

They were recovered by police -- after a **shootout !**

The loss of the dangerous isotopes was **never reported** to the radioactive-sources authorities !

The police seem to have been deliberately left unaware of the seriousness of the situation at the time of their recovery & were more concerned about the amount of bullet holes in the recovered car “*… we think about 18*”

The camera is the size of a large handbag but can weigh up to 30kg due to the heavy radiation shielding of lead & depleted uranium -- not easy to lose you’d think

2 of them were lost because they were stored in the boot of a car instead of the legally required safe storage facility. The car was stolen from the carpark of the company office & accommodation unit in an apartment block in Airvos Avenue

The dangerous isotopes are continually emitting radiation, even when contained in the heavily shielded camera & were usually kept inside the apartment or the boot of the car instead of an approved storage facility -- *away from people*

There have been many instances of people taking the radioactive source from the camera -- sometimes totally unaware of the lethal potential of this pill-sized death-trap attached to a small chain. Many of these people -- along with the people they encountered or were with later -- received high doses of radiation which made them very sick or caused death

3.2.7.  Lost radiography source, Morocco, 1984
In this serious accident, eight members of the public died from overexposure to radiation from a radiography source. A 1.1 TBq (30 Ci) 192Ir source became disconnected from its … shielded container ... a passer-by picked up the tiny metal cylinder and took it home ... and a total of 8 persons (the passer-by, members of his family and some relatives) died; the clinical diagnosis was 'lung haemorrhages'. It was initially assumed that the deaths were the result of poisoning. Only after the last family member had died was it suspected that the deaths might have been caused by radiation…
This is a classic example of a radiography accident and of the consequences that can ensue when no radiation surveys are performed to ensure that a source has returned to the fully shielded position.
